## Introduction

In this challenge you will reinforce the **most important concepts** of ReactJS and learn even more concepts that will be used in all applications you will develop in the future.

As it is a challenge, he needs some knowledge in addition to what is covered in this module, so it is important that he has autonomy so that he can research these things if he does not know how to solve it. So remember, **take it easy** and **believe in your process.** Learning here is very important, but you will definitely be able to leave here with a lot of cool knowledgeðŸ’œ

## About the Challenge

In this challenge, you will develop a **to-do list** style task control application, which contains the following functionalities:

- Add a new task
- Mark and unmark a task as complete
- Remove a task from the list
- Show task completion progress

Although there are few features, you will need to remember concepts such as:

- States
- State immutability
- Lists and keys in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization

To complete this challenge, you may need to do some research to learn about array manipulation methods like `map`, `filter` or even `reduce`.

If you want to delve even deeper into React concepts, we recommend reading the new React beta documentation, which explains in depth about React concepts and how to think about React application design.
